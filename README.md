# KMeter-OSX
A Macintosh OSX version of Martin Zuther's Excellent K-Meter. Both a standalone and VST plug in. 

I'm assuming you're here because you already know what a K-Meter is and why you need one for your audio work. If you don't check out Martin's site for all the details. For now, this repo just has the binaries of the Macintosh OSX version I created. At the time the current version of OSX was 10.11.4 (El Capitain).

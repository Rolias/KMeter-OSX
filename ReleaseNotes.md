#Release Notes

## 26-April-2016
1. More Mac like. Support for Mac packages. The kmeter folder is now _inside_ the package for all three versions. You just drag a single time around now to install. Much nicer. 
2. Built with v. 4.2.1 of the Juce library
3. Added an icon to the standalone version. 
4. Skin updated. Slight patterned background and a little darker. Martin and I like it, if you don't please write your suggestion for a new look on the back of a $100 bill and send it to me. I'll let Martin know.
